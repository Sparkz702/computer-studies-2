    <h1>What is Computer?</h1>
    A computer is an electronic device that accepts data and processes it into a meaningful result called information<br><img src="computer image.jpeg"><br>
    Computer appears in various forms and therefore need to be organized systematically into classes or groups.In this chapter,computers will be classified into:<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Generation</li>
        <li>Type</li>
        <li>Size</li>

    <h1>Classification of Computer by Generation</h1>
    Each stage of computer development (generation) was usually associated with one sort of technological innovation or another.Each innovation
    (new discovery) usually makes possible certain things which were not possible earlier.The classification into generations was based upon the capabilities
    of the computers and the electronic technology available at their time.Presently there are five computer generations as follows

    <h1>Classification of Computer by type</h1>
    computers can be classified according to the types of data processed.They are: <br>a.Analog<br>b.Digital, and<br>c.Hybrid<br>
    a.Analog computers:These are computers that measure and process data which are physical in nature such as continuous variations or changes
    in speed,temperature,pressure and amount of current following.The physical quantity or data is represented by a value that is proportional
    to it.Examples of Analog computers include:car speedometer,thermometer,barometer,electric meter,fuel guage.<br><br><br>
    b.Digital computers:These are computers that process data that are in discrete form rather than in continuous form.They process data,which
    are represented by a combination of discrete(individual) electric pulses denoted by 0sv and 1s(binary number).That is,digital computers 
    interpret electrical pulses which can either  be ON(1) or OFF(0)<br><br><br>
    c.Hybrid computers:These are computers that have the combined features of both analog and digital computers.That is the hybrid computers
    can be used to process data in both discrete form and variable form.It can convert cinalog.A good example of hybrid computer is the petrol
    pumping machine which can measure the liquid petrol passing through the pump in analog form and then convert it to digital form by displaying
    the volume and the corresponding monetary value on the screen of the pump

  <div id="ClassificationofComputerbySize" class="container-fluid">
    <h1>Classification of computer by size</h1>
    computers can be classified according to their various sizes especially the IUO of the central processor.The computer can therefore be classified
    as follows:<br>a.Supercomputers<br>b.Mainframe computers<br>c.Minicomputers<br>d.Microcomputers<br><br><br>
    a.Supercomputers:These are the biggest,fastest and the most expensive computer.They are used for performing extremely complicated tasks
    and complex calculations.Supercomputers are used mainly for weather forecasting,oil exploration.Engineering designs include aircraft designs.
    Also,it is used for research in the scientific field.<br><br><br>
    b.Mainframe computers:The mainframe is a big,high speed computer.It consists of a very powerful central computer which is linked by cables to hundreds
    of terminals and is capable of accepting inputs from all of them simuntaneously,that is in form of a network of users.A terminal serves as an
    input/output device consisting of a keyboard and a monitor.A mainframe has many times more processing power than a personal computer(PC)
    and alsohas a larger storage facility.Mainframe computers are used by large organisations such as banks,industral companies and government agencies.<br><br><br>
    c.Minicomputers:These look like mainframe computers but are smaller,slower and less expensive than the mainframe.They can also support a 
    network of several user terminals,but not as many as that of mainframe.They have less memory storage and processing capabilities compaired
    to mainframes.<br><br><br>
    d.Microcomputers:These are the smallest compared with the other three.They are very portable,compact and the most popular.The micro computer
    is often referred to as the personal computer(PC)
